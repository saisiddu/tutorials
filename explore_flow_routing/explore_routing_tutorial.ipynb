    "This notebook is a computational narrative using the [Landlab](http://landlab.github.io) Python-based modeling toolkit that allows scientists and students to build numerical landscape models. This notebook also utilizes the following open source research software libraries: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org). The software environment is provided by the [CUAHSI JupyterHub server](https://jupyter.cuahsi.org). \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is made of text cells, including the cell you are reading now, and code cells. The order in which you run the cells matters. The notebook cells are generally designed to be run top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells have the following characters to their left:\n",
    "* `In [ ]:` is a cell yet to be run.\n",
    "* `In [*]:` is a cell that is running.\n",
    "* `In [n]:` where `n` is an integer, is a cell that has run. The number indicates the sequence the cell was run, i.e. the first cell run is `n`=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a notebook is ran one cell at a time. Place your cursor in a code cell, hold down `shift` and then also press `enter`. You can even experiment with typing your own code into a cell and running that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can run groups of cells by clicking `Cell` on the menu above and then selecting among the various run options. This is also where you can clear outputs from previous runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also `shift` + `enter` in a text cell to advance your place in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this page](https://github.com/landlab/tutorials/blob/master/README.md) for more instructions on how to use an interactive Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you run this notebook the model outputs you generate are saved in your personal user space in the virtual computer through Hydroshare. These outputs are available for you to plot and explore using the plotting functions. We will plot model output at the end of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your final results can be saved to Hydroshare as a resource (see section 9.0 below). Unwanted model output can be deleted at anytime from your space, including by running the final code block of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an error occurs, click on the upper menu bar item, `Kernal` and then select `Restart and Clear Outputs` in the drop down menu.\n",

    "From left to right, the terms in Equation (1) represent local acceleration, convective acceleration, gradients of fluid pressure and bed elevation, and friction. Because this equation is difficult (i.e., almost impossible) to solve explicitly, approximations are commonly used. The simplest approximation, the Kinematic Wave model, only retains the friction term, making it the simplest approximation one can use. The Landlab `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow` component provides a 2-D locally implicit kinematic wave solution in which energy slope is assumed to be equal to the bed slope. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusive model developed from Equation (1) neglects the first two terms. The Landlab `OverlandFlow` component (Adams et al. 2017) adapts a 2D hydrodynamic algorithm similar to the diffusive approximation with negligible advection term (de Almeida et al., 2012) used in LISFLOOD-FP. The flow geometry is assumed to be rectangular and of constant flow width. The approximation used in `OverlandFlow` is more accurate but also more computationally expensive than the approximation used in `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The natural catchment used in this tutorial and studied in Adams et al. (2017) is the Spring Creek watershed, a steep 27 km$^2$ watershed located in central Colorado. The digital elevation model (DEM) we will use has a resolution of 30 meters. To clearly contrast landscape shape, this notebook uses a modeled \"synthetic\" landscape produced using a model developed in Landlab by coupling hillslope diffusion and stream-power erosion rules. The landscape evolution model was run on a 36 km$^2$ area represented by regular grids with a node spacing of 30 m. \n",

    "\n",
    "We will run the two overland flow models for 6 hours. A storm begins at the onset of the simulation and lasts for 2 hours. We will visualize water depths across the watershed over the course of the simulation and plot hydrographs at the outlet and two internal nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In repeated model experiments you can investigate the influence of runoff intensity, runoff duration, and surface resistance on streamflow hydrographs. You can organize your approach by running the two models and saving results from each watershed domain before running the models for the other domain.  \n",

    "1. How do watershed shape and drainage area affect hydrograph characteristics? \n",

    "At this point in the notebook, you should have produced a plot of three hydrographs from different points in the Spring Creek watershed, produced from overland flow driven by the base storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six scenarios to explore: two different watersheds and three different storms, if you use the default parameters. If you explore different Manning's roughness values run all six scenarios by systematically changing the `basin_flag` and `storm_flag` in Code Block 2 and rerunning all of the code blocks sequentially. Save the hydrograph plots for each scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions if you are using this as a laboratory exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Include those plots in a document that also contains your typed answers to each of the questions below. Answer all of the questions with complete sentences. Try to be as specific and as quantitative as you can. For example, you can compare times to peak discharge and peak discharge values among the scenarios. You are encouraged to discuss the results of the models with your classmates, but the text you turn in must be your own thoughts and words.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What aspects of the hydrograph change at the outlet as the storm gets longer or more intense? Are there aspects of the outlet hydrograph that are not sensitive to the storm duration or intensity? Do the midstream and upstream hydrographs exhibit the same sensitivity to storm duration and intensity? Explain why.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the differences in the hydrograph response in the outlets of the two watersheds? How does the watershed shape influence the hydrograph shape?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now compare the hydrograph shapes across the three different locations in the watersheds. Compare only between similar points (e.g. mid or upstream locations) and between the same storm characteristics. How does watershed shape affect hydrograph shape? Does it impact all locations in the same manner? Do different storm characteristics exaggerate the differences between the different watersheds?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now compare the results between the two different watershed. How different are hydrograph characteristics between the square and natural watershed (Spring Creek)?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Please compare your answers to the questions you answered before running the models. Do the model results match your intuition? If not, do you think your intuition was wrong, or the model was wrong, or both? Remember, models are helpful for learning but they are highly simplified representations of the real world. Without knowing the details of the model, does it seem like something is missing from your model results?"
